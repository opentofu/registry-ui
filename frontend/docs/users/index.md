# The OpenTofu Registry for Users

OpenTofu is a tool that works with integrations made by the community called _providers_. In addition to that, community-made modules simplify many common tasks. The OpenTofu Registry contains an index pointing to thousands of providers and thousands of modules on GitHub you can use. You can install them automatically by adding a code snippet to your project and running `tofu init`.
