# Publishing a provider version

Once you have finished [creating your provider](/docs/providers/creating) and [wrote your documentation](/docs/providers/docs), you can proceed to publish your provider. First, create a GitHub repository named `terraform-provider-YOURNAME` and publish your source code in this repository. You can then proceed to [create a GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).

~> Note, that your release name **must** start with a `v` and must follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Using the scaffolding (recommended)

If you used the [terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework) as your starting point, it also includes the necessary GitHub Actions and [goreleaser file](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework/blob/main/.goreleaser.yml) needed to create a release.

You will need to create the secrets called `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` and `PASSPHRASE` in order to sign your release. GPG keys ensure the integrity of your provider binaries. While OpenTofu allows you to submit a provider without a GPG key for compatibility reasons, adding a GPG key helps keep your users safe and is also required if you intend to submit your provider to the Terraform Registry. The workflow in the terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework repository assumes you will use a GPG key.

Please follow the [GitHub documentation on generating a GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key). You do not need to add the public key to your GitHub account, but instead you can [submit it to the OpenTofu Registry](/docs/providers/adding) in the next step.

~> Keep your private key safe! If your private key becomes public, others will be able to produce correctly signed binaries for your provider! The private key should only be in your GitHub secrets and backed up on your own computer. You should never need to submit the private key anywhere.

Once this is set up, proceed to create a release named `vYOURVERSION` on GitHub and wait for the GitHub Actions job to complete.

## Manually (for the adventurous)

If you are feeling adventurous, you can also create your release artifacts manually. You will need to produce the following artifacts:

- `terraform-provider-YOURNAME_VERSION_PLATFORM_ARCH.zip` containing your provider binary named `terraform-provider-YOURNAME` or `terraform-provider-YOURNAME.exe` and any supplemental files. (e.g. `terraform-provider-aws_5.68.0_darwin_amd64.zip`)
- `terraform-provider-YOURNAME_SHA256SUMS` containing the SHA256 checksums and filenames for all files in your release, one in each line in the format of `<checksum>  <filename>\n` (e.g. `0501ccb379b74832366860699ca6d5993b164ec44314a054453877d39c384869  terraform-provider-aws_5.68.0_darwin_amd64.zip`)
- `terraform-provider-YOURNAME_SHA256SUMS.sig` containing a detached GPG signature for the SHA256SUMS file (without ASCII-armor). This file is optional for OpenTofu.

~> The versions in the filenames **must not** contain the `v` prefix.

OpenTofu supports the following platform names:

- `darwin` (MacOS)
- `linux`
- `windows`
- `freebsd`
- `openbsd`
- `solaris`

You can use these in conjunction with the following architecture names:

- `amd64`
- `arm64`
- `386`
- `arm`

Once you are done, you can upload your release to GitHub and [submit your provider to the OpenTofu Registry](/docs/providers/adding) and the [Terrafom Registry](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/publishing).
