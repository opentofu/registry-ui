# OpenTofu Registry Search Contribution Guide

Welcome and thank you for contributing to the OpenTofu Registry Search. Before you begin, please familiarize yourself with the [README](README.md), which contains all the information on how to run the indexing and how to run the frontend.

## Signing off your commits

If you decide to this repository, we ask for a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) sign-off to your commits. You can do so by using the `-s` option to your commit:

```
git commit -s -m "Commit message"
```

Please make sure that you set the `user.name` and `user.email` configuration in your local git config matches your GitHub settings.

## Architecture

This repository is split into 3 parts.

### Backend

The backend uses [libregistry](https://github.com/opentofu/libregistry) to access the [OpenTofu Registry dataset](https://github.com/opentofu/registry) in order to generate the JSON files containing version information, clone the repositories of each module and provider to extract the markdown documentation and upload it to an S3-style bucket. The backend only runs when we index data, the dataset is otherwise statically served to the frontend.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using ReactJS and fetches the data from the API generated by the backend through the search worker. (This is currently hosted at [api.opentofu.org](https://api.opentofu.org/).)

### Search worker

In order to power search, we index the data in a PostgreSQL database and provide responses to search queries using a Cloudflare worker. The search worker also proxies requests through to the S3-style bucket.

## Development environment

### Backend

You can run the backend by running `go run ./cmd/generate/main.go` in the [`backend`](backend) directory. This command
has a number of options detailed below.

Example: `namespace/name/targetsystem,othernamespace/othername` |

#### Storage options

The system supports storing in a local directory or in an S3 bucket. Passing S3 options automatically switches to the
S3 option.

##### Local directory

By default, the storage will write the resulting documents in a local directory. You can change where this directory
is located by passing the `--destination-dir` option.

##### S3 bucket

The S3 storage has the following options:

| Command line option | Environment variable    | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | Access key (required).                                                                       |
|                     | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Secret key (required).                                                                       |
| `--s3-bucket`       |                         | S3 bucket to use for uploads (required).                                                     |
| `--s3-endpoint`     | `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`   | S3 endpoint to use for uploads.                                                              |
| `--s3-path-style`   |                         | Use path-style URLs for S3.                                                                  |
| `--s3-ca-cert-file` | `AWS_CA_BUNDLE`         | File containing the CA certificate for the S3 endpoint. Defaults to the system certificates. |
| `--s3-region`       | `AWS_REGION`            | Region to use for S3 uploads. Defaults to auto-detection.                                    |

#### Blocklist

This system supports explicitly blocking providers and modules from being indexed by using a blocklist. You can pass a JSON file using the `--blocklist` option of the following format:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "namespace/name": "Reason why it was blocked (shown to the user).",
    "namespace/": "This entire namespace is blocked."
  },
  "modules": {
    "namespace/name/targetsystem": "Reason why it was blocked (shown to the user).",
    "namespace/name/": "Anything under this name is blocked.",
    "namespace//": "This entire namespace is blocked."
  }
}
```

As the listed providers and modules are in the registry dataset, they will still appear in the UI, but the contents of
the documentation are not shown. This is useful to comply with DMCA take-down requests, erroneous license detection, or
to honor the wishes of the provider/module author.

### Frontend

In order to run the frontend, enter the [frontend](frontend) directory, install required dependencies by running
`pnpm install` and then run `pnpm run dev`. You can create a `.env` file to configure where the generated dataset and
search API are:

```env
VITE_DATA_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Search

The search API is independent of the backend because it requires a PostgreSQL database. It consists of an indexer to
fill the database and a Cloudflare worker to answer search queries.

The indexer reads from the generated search index feed located at the `/search.ndjson` endpoint of the generated data
from the backend and fills the database. You can pass the `--connection-string` option in order to supply it with a
database connection.

The worker receives all calls to the API from the frontend and processes search requests, passing on any requests it
cannot handle to the R2 (S3-style) bucket containing the dataset. For development, you can set up a `wrangler.toml` in
the following format:

```toml
#:schema node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json
name = "registry-ui-search"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
```

## GitHub Actions

This repository also contains an automated workflow for GitHub Actions. This workflow periodically runs the indexing and
requires the following secrets to be set up:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`
- `S3_BUCKET`

Additionally, the `Index (manual)` workflow allows you to manually trigger the generation for a namespace, name, or
target system, including an option to force the regeneration from scratch.
